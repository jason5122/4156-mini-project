General:
* Includes sometimes come before header guards.
* There are lots of duplicate imports.
  * Course.{h,cpp}
  * Department.{h,cpp}

class Course:
* Course(...) constructor initializes enrolledStudentCount to 500.
* enrollStudent() doesn't correctly return true/false.
* dropStudent() doesn't correctly return true/false.
* getInstructorName() and Course::getCourseTimeSlot() are mixed up.
* isCourseFull()'s conditional is reversed.

class Department:
* getDepartmentChair() returns a fixed string instead of the member variable.
* dropPersonFromMajor() doesn't check if greater than 0 before decrementing.

class RouteController:
* dropStudentFromCourse() doesn't have an endpoint.
* setCourseLocation(), setCourseInstructor(), and setCourseTime() don't match their endpoint names
  (/changeCourseLocation, /changeCourseTeacher, and /changeCourseTime, respectively).

CourseUnitTests.cpp:
* CourseUnitTests::testCourse is a global raw pointer which uses new/delete, which is very bad!
  This can easily be a stack variable instead.
